#### v2.0.7
- Added bless-compatible VBoxHfs driver (by @nms42)
- Added compatibility with OpenCore logging protocols

#### v2.0.6

#### v2.0.5
- Disable mouse polling when it does not fit the timer window
- Include AppleEvent-compatible UsbKbDxe driver in the package
- Support extracting APFS driver from the extentents as defined by the spec
- Fix Apple image signature verification failure on multiple platforms
- Temporary remove AppleImageLoader from the package (till it gains Secure Boot compat)

**WARNING**: Apple image signature verification implementation is not prone to untrusted input as of yet.

#### v2.0.4
- Implemented a complete port of AppleEvent (thx Download-Fritz for the base)
- Reduced mouse polling timer to fix booting issues on some Dell laptops

#### v2.0.3
- Embedded signature verification into ApfsDriverLoader
- Removed AppleLoadImage support from ApfsDriverLoader due to security reasons
  * AppleLoadImage can be compromised, because our implementation isn't embedded into firmware, so it is possible, that attacker can simply bypass security checks by adding dummy implementation
- Added FvOnFv2Thunk into FirmwareVolume injector to create back-compatibility for broken UEFI implementation on some boards, for example MSI

#### v2.0.2
- Fixed potential memory leaks
- Added support for AppleEfiFatBinary with signature verification (AppleImageLoader 1.5.0)
- Extended AppleLoadImage protocol with signature verification of EFI binary (AppleImageLoader 1.5.0)

#### v2.0.1
- Implemented support for AppleLoadImage protocol

	* Now for security reasons you should load AppleLoadImage.efi right before ApfsDriverLoader.efi. If you use Clover bootloader, you can just put AppleLoadImage.efi and ApfsDriverLoader.efi into your drivers64uefi folder.
